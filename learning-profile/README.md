# **Personal Learning Website**

**Long story short, place to document my learning and practice writing code.**

---

## **30/7/25**: 
==Reorgainzed css structure== --> Made a global.css to store reapeated styles, i.e  **.panel**, **text-box1**, **text-box2**. 

~~**30/7/25:** Get music section in **who am i** done tomorrow (31/7/25).~~
 
---

## **31/7/25**:
 . <u>Music section on hold</u>. **Need to learn CSS grid** to be able to make a more efficient layout. Also potentially implementing a spotify widget for music I listen to...embed a playlist?

 . **Solved** the *github crisis*, still need to familiarize myself by using it more often. 




 **Learnt**: 
 `<table>` don't know when I'll use that. 
 `<form>` `<label>` ` Need more practice on creating forms.

 Form code snippet â¬‡
 ```
    <form>
        <label for="">First Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="firstname" name="firstname" value="David">
        <label for="">Surname</label>
        <input type="text" id="surname" name="surname" value="Smith">
        <input type="submit" value="submit">
    </form>
```
**IMPORTANT**: For forms first you need the **label** then the **input**. Then follows the <u style="font-size: larger;">'type'</u> of input you'd like, the <u style="font-size: larger;">'id'</u> of the input then <u style="font-size: larger;">'name'</u>, lastly I think the <u style="font-size: larger;">'value'</u> is optional.



## **Question**: What are CSS frameworks? 
CSS frameworks are **libraries** that provide **pre-written stylesheets** to <u>simplify web design</u>.

### **FOCUS** - 1/8/25
**Research more about these CSS frameworks (Tailwind CSS?)**
Keep ==core focus== on `display: grid;` to <b style="font-size: larger;">sort out *music section*.</b> 
<br>

**ANKI CARDS** 
- [x] **Form related questions** (think memorising syntax, written questions)

### **1/8/25**: 
**Sorted** the layout for the music section. <u>Need to fill it with content</u>.

==NOTE==: Not too much done today, smh... Need to **lock in** brother.

## Tasks for 2/8/25
- [ ] Complete music section **today** with <strike>spotify widget also implemented</strike>
**update**: seems **implementing spotify widget is too tedious** since the example was working yesterday, and now it's not working. <br>I'm just going to **manually** do it with, **music thumbnails** with a link attached to it directing to youtube.

==**ISSUE**==: apparently trying to put overlay text over a image is much harder than anticipated.

**Maybe problem** with `display: grid;` interfering with what I'm trying to do ?? 

**UPDATE**: ==That wasn't the case.==

<hr>

## Task for 3/8/25

- [x] fix music section
==**UPDATE**==: GREAT SUCCESS!. I managed to fix the <u>music tab section</u>. Got it all on a separate html file but now **I know how to do it!** What a relief. There was probably a easier way but I did it nonetheless. 

Now I'll finish it up properly **tomorrow**. But for now I rest.

## Task for 4/8/25

- [ ] ~~Start planning the Game section
. Use `display: grid;`~~
